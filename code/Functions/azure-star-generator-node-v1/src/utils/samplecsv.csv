2021-01-08,Manager,Sophia Chen,Financial Services UX Redesign FY21,Strength,Client Work,4,"Role: Supervisor/TeamLead

Updated On: 08 Jan 2021

Did I achieve what was expected of me?

Yes

What are my most notable achievements and what can I improve?

Jamie served as lead UX designer and UX lead for the project. Within this role, he was willing to put in the hours to address whatever was needed, but he was also not afraid to push back and articulate with client asks that didn't make sense. Ever patient, Jamie helped train up his onshore and offshore teams on design assets as well as the client team who had very little Adobe exposure. Jamie helped implement cutting edge design assets capabilities that will be great credentials for Consulting Firm as a whole: connected design components, design library, responsive prototypes, design projects; his efforts led to his receipt of Account-wide recognition at a Financial Services Consulting Firm all-hands account meeting in October.

What am I ready for next and what do I need to do to get there?

Looking ahead Jamie should look to conduct demos for the broader digital asset library and XP communities to share lessons learned around connected design components and continue to be one of our key subject matter expert's within the digital asset library and design assets space. I hope that I get a chance to work with Jamie on future design projects."
2021-06-11,Peer,Marcus T. Wilson,Financial Services UX Redesign FY21,Strength,Client Work,2,"Jamie was the design system lead for the design system Assets digital asset library track at Financial Services. He was the only onshore design system subject matter expert that was directly involved in the track, and directly interfaced with the client.

He also had to align the digital asset library track and approaches with standard and already established patterns on the broader design system platform. This required in-depth alignment with me as the experience design lead. Jamie and I spent many meetings working through these alignments in great detail, and this shaped a very strong understanding and justification of the design decisions in the project.

The client recognized this and has accepted and acknowledged Jamie as a true subject matter expert and very strong design system UX designer. That is unique at Financial Services because of their significantly elevated expectation to any resource on the account.

I wouldn't hesitate a second to work with Jamie again."
2021-07-16,Manager,Patricia L. Rodriguez,Financial Services UX Redesign FY21,Strength,Client Work,3,"How did I do?

Great work

What impact did I make?

Jamie, you have a unique ability to translate business strategies into user experience designs and UX design. The client was extremely impressed by your intelligence and grasp of the design platform.

How did I make use of my skills and strengths?

You stayed extremely focused on the objectives and provided unbiased advise on critical issues.  

What can I do to continue to grow?

Keep doing what you are doing. You are a key asset to the practice and should continue to help Consulting Firm build our brand as the leader in applying design expertise with strategic marketing expertise. Thanks Jamie!"
2021-07-28,Peer,Trevor Bennett,Banking Portal UX FY21,Strength,Client Work,2,"How did I do?

Great work

What impact did I make?

As I am new to design system technology, Jamie was critical in expanding my knowledge of the design system ecosystem, best practices, and supporting technologies, so that I could be successful in the role of interaction design lead. Jamie's ability to manage incoming UX/ideation requests and prioritize accordingly, while also providing client push back and technical leadership to both design system and design teams, was also quite impactful. His attention to negative trends helped escalate to project leadership allowing the team to pivot, revalidate estimations, and adjust resources to bring the project back on track.

How did I make use of my skills and strengths?

Given the high interface complexity of Banking Industry's website, Jamie's depth of design system expertise and willingness to participate in core frontend design technologies directly contributed to the project's success. For example, Visual UI components incurred a combination of client requirements and design system updates which added unexpected complexity - a creative solution allowed the design team to preserve background image responsive design rules with design variations and solved a device vs CSS image resolution challenge.

His ability to communicate his vision and articulate the project/task's goal in a clear and concise way was another strength. For example - his vision for the Product Comparison interface contains a piece of every design system nuance from content/experience modules, to categorization, to custom interface components, was well understood, allowing the design team to build and create POCs towards that supported that goal. 

Jamie has strength in project management methodology. For example, to gain control and understanding of multiple workstreams, he set up a working spreadsheet of all activities, their current progress, and current owners, discussed regularly with project leads."
2021-08-05,Manager,Priya Mehta,Banking Portal UX FY21,Strength,Client Work,5,"How did I do?

Great work

What impact did I make?

Jamie was a standout resource in helping get the Banking Industry project off the ground and moving. The project experienced any number of significant set backs and challenges and Jamie dug in and committed himself to driving success. Without Jamie's dedication and drive the project would not have recovered. 

Jamie stretched himself to picking up on interface prototypes after an extended period of focusing in design system digital asset library, helped drive progress on the adoption of our Rapid Prototyping Framework, and established great relations with the client. 

Jamie has also played an overall leadership role for the project and has helped with identifying issues across the board and helped bring the new Delivery Lead up to speed and has really work above and beyond to help counter balance early resources issues and a very junior team.

How did I make use of my skills and strengths?

Jamie is an incredibly disciplined and focused technologist. He brought that discipline to the team and helped bring a rigor and level of focus that was needed. 

Jamie leads by example and is one of the not the hardest work team members, and this comes across to both the client and the team. Jamie cares a great deal about delivering a quality product to the customer and doing it the right way which is crucial to delivering with value to the client. 

Jamie also does a great job of creating a collaborative and open working environment, encouraging everyone's input and looking for consensus from the team which promotes a good team culture. 

Jamie's knowledge of the design system platform is deep and fairly broad. In particular his knowledge of design management platform was a great asset for the project. As important Jamie is great learner, so even when dealing with areas he is less familiar with he is quite skilled at learning fast and rapidly developing expertise and helping others to do so as well. This platform knowledge is key for this project and gives Jamie great credibility with the client."
2022-06-29,Other,Carlos Delgado,Banking Portal UX FY22,Strength,Client Work,3,"Jamie has been an outstanding lead UX designer and a very valuable resource on our project - recognized from both the Consulting Firm and client side. He always looks beyond the challenges at hand and ensures our solutions and delivery cover all aspects of the requirement both technically and functionally. Jamie's mindset is always centered around delivering the best work that we can for the client. This is directly reflected in his day-to-day deliverables, management style & ongoing commitment to the team.

In addition to being a valued team member, Jamie has played an important role as a mentor and coach for me over the last year in my own career progression from Consultant to Manager. Not having a large technical background, Jamie always takes the time to explain solutions and technical approaches in a way in which is easy to digest. He is very approachable and is always willing to provide feedback and recognition. Jamie is someone who I have learned a great deal from on this project not only in respect to design system, but also as a leader and developing my own management style."
2022-06-29,Other,Tara Singh,Banking Portal UX FY22,Strength,Client Work,4,"Jamie is one the strongest solution UX designer I have ever worked with. His technical skills are impeccable. He is an excellent leader and always strive to act in best interest of organization, client and his team. He exhibits outstanding skills even in difficult situations.

Jamie always comes so prepared for his meetings, he always jot down the pros and cons for every solution he is proposing to the client. This helps clients to take decisions and helps the team to get things sorted out quickly.

Jamie is a very hands on person when it comes to technical solutioning, debugging or analysis.

There is always something new to learn from him in every interaction. He has always been a great support during my transition to new role as FED Lead. He is always encouraging and leads from front, he positively influences those around him to challenge and develop their capabilities.

Thanks for your contributions to Banking Portal project."
2022-06-30,Other,Kayla R. Phillips,Banking Portal UX FY22,Strength,Client Work,3,"Jamie has been one of the best onshore UX designers I've had got a chance to work with. I appreciate the clarity he provides for project goals and his proactive actions towards the upcoming project tasks and releases. Our team has successfully delivered two of the interface prototypes for the Banking Industry project and third is at the verge of getting live. A big share of this success must be attributed to Jamie. 'This was the smoothest releases we had' is what we heard from the client team when we went live with MBNA site. Without Jamie, this would not have been possible. I remember when Jamie joined the team, the project was not in a very good shape mostly due to covid pandemic. However, with his experience, leadership skills, in-depth knowledge, confidence and proactiveness, Jamie ensured to get the project back on track. This truly is an extraordinary accomplishment. I appreciate the opportunities Jamie offered me to learn and develop as a design system UX designer. His feedback has helped me accomplishing my career goals. And I would like to thank him for all the guidance he provided, not only to me but to entire ATCI team."
2022-07-01,Other,Victor Ray Kim,Banking Portal UX FY22,Strength,Client Work,1,"Jamie is my UX lead in Banking Industry CMS engagement. This is a complex project with several distributed features (if I may call it this way) across platforms and yet successfully completed migration of 3 websites. It stands testimony to avid task master in Jamie for streamlining the design system, design activities.

The collab and solutioning sessions with him have shown me new ways of tackling a problem using design system within the client made constraints. I appreciate Jamie making time to enable team members (obviously, myself included) with these sessions, as well as the extra effort to keep the confluence documentation up to date.

He is outspoken and prompt in his feedback, which helps me improve on my shortcomings and be a better lead."
2022-07-03,Manager,Hannah Schmidt,Banking Portal UX FY22,Strength,Client Work,5,"Jamie has been on the Banking Industry CMS program almost since the start and has made an outstanding, distinctive contribution over that time period, I would rank it in the top 2% among 100+ resources participating in the program. Noting the following:

1. Technical Depth: Technical coverage and expertise is very extensive - broad and deep. Jamie fulfills the role of enterprise UX designer not just design system UX designer. For example, over and above the design system focus, the program has implemented - client included - Jamie's vision of an advanced, multi-tenant release train and release mgmt process which exceeds what has been accomplished at any of the other 5 CAD banks (based on my experience leading design projects at each of these banks). Client has give kudos to Consulting Firm for this contribution which was spearheaded by Jamie.

2. Work Ethic: Much of the Banking Industry CMS program depends on client resources (30-40% of the team) who are very new to the platform being implemented and new to the advanced concepts being introduced. Jamie has devoted many hours, conversations, pages of detailed documentation and other coaching to help said client resources and leaders be successful in the transformation. As a result Banking Industry's systems and integration pods have transformed from lagging to leading in supporting the overall program; this work ethic and commitment was instrumental in recent client negotiations which will likely double the fees vs. the $5.6M SOW.

3. Transparent Communications: A significant aspect of the project has been to upskill both onshore and offshore Consulting Firm resources which Jamie accomplished with great effectiveness. During Covid Consulting Firm experienced attrition and other workforce challenges that required constant team building, communications and hands-on joint solutioning. The quality of the team over the past year has dramatically improved under Jamie's direction evidenced by lower defect rates, less rework following code reviews, higher throughput of features and - above all - regular, reliable PROD release of new features for critical client web interface prototypes."
2023-03-08,Other,Tara Singh,Banking Portal UX FY23,Strength,Client Work,4,"Jamie has always been the strongest pillar for Banking Industry CMS project's success. Jamie wore different hats during the course of this project.

He is the quickest with debugging or finding RCA for defects and always suggests solutions by listing their pros and cons.

It was a pleasure working with Jamie on Banking Industry CMS project. I would definitely want to work with him again in future."
2023-05-04,Other,Carlos Delgado,Banking Portal UX FY23,Strength,Client Work,4,"Jamie was an instrumental resource to our successful delivery of 5 Public interface prototypes for the Banking Industry CMS Migration Project.

2024-06-04,Client,Deepa Kumar,Tech Industry Advertising UX,Strength,Client Work,5,"Hi - I wanted to take a moment to provide some feedback on Jamie Lee and his role in the Tech Industry Ads website redesign project.

Jamie was crucial to the UX design of our new platform. He built a blueprint and made key design decisions, many of them independently because he did not have an FTE counterpart with comparable experience. 

He overfunctioned beyond his key remit into many technical areas - whatever it took to successfully deliver the project. This included leading our security, privacy, and compliance work to an all-green status, which was a significant achievement in the current environment. And incredibly, he stepped up to help when one of our other old websites went down, even though he wasn't involved in that project at all.

And throughout all of this, Jamie demonstrated a positive attitude, growth mindset, and sense of humor - even during hard and stressful times. This contributed in a large way to the positive team culture which was critical to our success.

Adobe has already recognized him as such and we wholeheartedly agree: Jamie is a ROCK STAR. His contributions were invaluable to the success of our project.

Thank you -Deepa"
